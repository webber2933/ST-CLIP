# STCLIP

This project is the official implementation of paper  [Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996) (**WACV 2025**), authored by Wei-Jhe Huang, Min-Hung Chen and Shang-Hong Lai.

## Installation 

Please check [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the environment.

## Data Preparation

Please check [DATA.md](DATA.md) to prepare data needed for training or inference. We provide the data for J-HMDB first, and the others will be released as soon as possible.

## Training and Inference

Please check [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for the training/inference instructions.
